/**
 * struct thermal_zone_device - structure for a thermal zone
 * @id:		unique id number for each thermal zone
 * @type:	the thermal zone device type
 * @device:	&struct device for this thermal zone
 * @trip_temp_attrs:	attributes for trip points for sysfs: trip temperature
 * @trip_type_attrs:	attributes for trip points for sysfs: trip type
 * @trip_hyst_attrs:	attributes for trip points for sysfs: trip hysteresis
 * @mode:		current mode of this thermal zone
 * @devdata:	private pointer for device private data
 * @trips:	an array of struct thermal_trip
 * @num_trips:	number of trip points the thermal zone supports
 * @trips_disabled;	bitmap for disabled trips
 * @passive_delay_jiffies: number of jiffies to wait between polls when
 *			performing passive cooling.
 * @polling_delay_jiffies: number of jiffies to wait between polls when
 *			checking whether trip points have been crossed (0 for
 *			interrupt driven systems)
 * @temperature:	current temperature.  This is only for core code,
 *			drivers should use thermal_zone_get_temp() to get the
 *			current temperature
 * @last_temperature:	previous temperature read
 * @emul_temperature:	emulated temperature when using CONFIG_THERMAL_EMULATION
 * @passive:		1 if you've crossed a passive trip point, 0 otherwise.
 * @prev_low_trip:	the low current temperature if you've crossed a passive
			trip point.
 * @prev_high_trip:	the above current temperature if you've crossed a
			passive trip point.
 * @need_update:	if equals 1, thermal_zone_device_update needs to be invoked.
 * @ops:	operations this &thermal_zone_device supports
 * @tzp:	thermal zone parameters
 * @governor:	pointer to the governor for this thermal zone
 * @governor_data:	private pointer for governor data
 * @thermal_instances:	list of &struct thermal_instance of this thermal zone
 * @ida:	&struct ida to generate unique id for this zone's cooling
 *		devices
 * @lock:	lock to protect thermal_instances list
 * @node:	node in thermal_tz_list (in thermal_core.c)
 * @poll_queue:	delayed work for polling
 * @notify_event: Last notification event
